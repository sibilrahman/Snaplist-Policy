    <h1>Privacy Policy for Snaplist</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: April 25, 2025</strong></p>
    <p>Welcome to Snaplist, a list management application developed by Snaplist Team ("we," "us," or "our"). Snaplist is currently in beta, and we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our Snaplist mobile application (the "App"). Please read this policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the App.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect information to provide and improve the App’s functionality. The types of information we may collect include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Information</strong>: When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, and account credentials (via email and password authentication). We may also collect device identifiers to enable synchronization across devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Snap and Message Details</strong>: We collect data related to the lists you create, including list names, list items (referred to as "snap details"), reminder settings, and any messages or notes associated with your lists (referred to as "message details").</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Personal Information</strong>: We collect usage data, such as how you interact with the App, to enhance your experience and improve the App.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information</strong>: We may collect information about your device, including the operating system, device model, and IP address, to ensure compatibility and optimize performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Offline Data</strong>: Data you create while offline (e.g., lists and reminders) is stored locally on your device and synced to our servers when you reconnect to the internet.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes. We may share your information in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Providers</strong>: We use Firebase (provided by Google LLC) for authentication (Firebase Authentication) and data storage (Firebase Firestore).

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>Your data is stored locally on your device for offline access and in Firebase Firestore for synchronization. We use Firebase’s security features, including encryption for data in transit and at rest, to protect your information. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. As the App is in beta, we are actively monitoring and improving our security practices.</p>
